# CIFAR-10 Neural Network Classifier

A basic neural network implementation for classifying CIFAR-10 images.

## Performance

- Training accuracy: 99.9% (overfitted)
- Test accuracy: 51.60%

## Future Improvements

The model is currently overfitting. Performance can be enhanced through:
- Data augmentation
- Regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L2)
- Architecture modifications
- Hyperparameter tuning

Contributions welcome to improve the model's generalization and test accuracy.
